# MonkeyShell
MonkeyShell is a PHP Shell Based On NotFoundShell/P0wnyShell

Love the idea of a password on a P0wnyShell, just want to create my own login interface. This is a simple PHP shell with a login interface.
The NotFoundShell with not found page is a good idea, but not useful in CTFs.

My default password atm is monkey, but you can change at the top of the monkeyshell.php file. I changed hash functions to sha256.


## Demo

Features are the same as NotFoundShell/P0wnyShell (Big thanks to the creators of those shells) :

Command history (using arrow keys <code>↑</code> <code>↓</code>)

Auto-completion of command and file names (using <code>Tab</code> key)

Navigate on the remote file-system (using <code>cd</code> command)

Upload a file to the server (using <code>upload <destination_file_name></code> command)
    
Download a file from the server (using <code>download <file_name></code> command)
    
Disconnect from PHP Shell (using <code>logout</code> command)

Have a Nice Day & Happy Hacking ;)
